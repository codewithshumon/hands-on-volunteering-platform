HandsOn Volunteer Platform
Welcome to the HandsOn Volunteer Platform! This is a full-stack web application built with React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It provides a seamless user authentication system with email verification, password reset functionality, and a secure login system. Users can sign up, verify their email, log in, and reset their password if needed. After successful authentication, users are redirected to the dashboard.

Features

1. User Authentication
   Signup: Users can create an account by providing their name, email, and password.

Email Verification: After signing up, users receive a 6-digit verification code via email. They are redirected to the verification page to enter the code.

Resend Verification Code: Users can resend the verification code after 3 minutes if they don't receive it.

Login: Users can log in using their email and password. If the email is not verified, they will be prompted to verify it first.

Password Reset: Users can reset their password by verifying their email and setting a new password.

2. Email Verification
   A 6-digit verification code is sent to the user's email during signup and password reset.

The code expires after 3 minutes.

Users can resend the verification code after 3 minutes.

3. Password Reset
   Users can click the "Forgot Password" button on the login page.

They will be redirected to a page where they need to verify their email.

After email verification, users can set a new password.

Upon successful password reset, users are redirected to the login page.

4. Dashboard
   After successful login, users are redirected to the dashboard.

The dashboard is a protected route and can only be accessed by authenticated users.
