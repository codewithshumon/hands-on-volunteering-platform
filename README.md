Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
Node.js (v16 or higher)
MongoDB (local or cloud-based)
NPM or Yarn (Node.js package managers)

1. Clone the Repository
   Clone the project repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hands-on-volunteer-platform.git
cd hands-on-volunteer-platform

2. Backend Setup
   Navigate to the backend directory:
   cd backend

Install dependencies:
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:

DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT=port_number
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

Replace the placeholders with your actual values:
<username> and <password>: Your MongoDB credentials.
your_jwt_secret_key: A secret key for JWT token generation.
your-email@gmail.com and your-gmail-app-password: Your Gmail credentials for sending emails.
your_cloudinary_cloud_name, your_cloudinary_api_key, and your_cloudinary_api_secret: Your Cloudinary credentials for handling file uploads.

Start the backend server:
npm start
The backend will run on http://localhost:PORT.

3. Frontend Setup
   Navigate to the frontend directory:
   cd ../frontend

Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the frontend development server:
npm run dev
The frontend will run on http://localhost:5173/.

4. Access the Application
   Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5173/.

You can now use the HandsOn Volunteer Platform locally.

5. Running in Production
   To deploy the application in production:

Backend:
Deploy the backend to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Render).
Update the .env file with production environment variables.

Frontend:
Build the frontend for production:
npm run build
Deploy the build folder to a static hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages).

6. Cron Job Setup
   The backend includes a cron job to automatically update event statuses (upcoming â†’ ongoing â†’ completed) and add eventHours to users. This runs automatically when the backend server starts.

7. Troubleshooting
   Backend not running: Ensure MongoDB is running and the .env file is correctly configured.
   Frontend not connecting to backend: Verify the backend server is running and update the API base URL in the frontend if necessary.

   Email not sending: Ensure the email credentials in .env are correct and enable "Less secure apps" in your Gmail account settings.
